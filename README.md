### Tracery
[Tracery](http://tracery.io) is a text generation library created by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/).
It's basically a big list of lists and templates you use to generate text in a Mad Libs-style, where certain parts of a sentence are selected at random from a larger group.

- [Online Tracery Editor](https://beaugunderson.com/tracery-writer/)
- [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/tree/master/data)
- Lets looks at some of the JSON files included in this repo and plug them in!

Time to try making our own. Break into groups and come up with an idea for your generator. Good bots have a simple narrow theme that is then expanded on to have a lot of possibility. 

- Start with a recent news headline, a fun meme, or a subject you're interested.
- Make a starter template sentence
- Make lists of things that could be swapped out
- Generate!

### Cheap Bots, Done Quick

[Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) is a fantastic twitterbot hosting platform by [George Buckenham](https://v21.io/) that lets you turn any Tracery generator into a Twitter bot. Here's all you need to do:

- Create a new twitter account
- Log in to [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) with your new twitter account
- Paste in the grammar from your tracery generator
- Test to make sure it works
- Set how often you want to tweet
- Go back into the twitter account and make a nice profile and banner image and description (let people know it's a bot)
- Done!

### Going Further
Tracery can be used in any javascript project, including with p5, to make generative websites and games. Visit the [github repo](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/tree/tracery2) for more on how to use it. Check out [Interruption Junction](http://squinky.me/interruption/) as something a little different using Tracery.

You can make more advanced Twitter bots that do things like markov text generation, uploading images, replying, and showing p5/processing images by programming them yourself in Node or Python. Dan Shiffman's The Coding Train has a great set of videos on making a [Twitter bot in Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU)
